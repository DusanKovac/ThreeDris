Hello!

In this assignment, it was implemented differently then how the previous assignment was done.
After reading the OpenGL Redbook and learning about VBO's and VAO's I decided to implement that 
system. 

[NOTE]: All parts of this assignment was done, Counter is in the bottom left of the screen and will
count down from 5 -> 0 and will set to R for restart option.



For you I have the normal window where I implemented all parts of the assignment.
[Do note]:
	I removed 3 fruit scoring, to reduce the number of lines. Making it easier for me to
	code.

To run this project, please use make and then run ./FruitTetris3D!
			[There are some warnings, which have no affect on the execution]

In this zip there are 3 cpp and 3 header files that I have customly created, and a couple others required for shaders and angel.h/robotarm.


fruit.cpp :

Fruit is my main file where I run all the glut/gl functions and run the main game logic 


tetrisblock.cpp/.h :

This is where I made the falling tetris block, instead of making an
object each time. It is initialised at the start and when adding the piece to 
the board the game will run the initialiser right after. This class handles all 
local translations of the piece and the drawing of it.

board.cpp/.h :

Here is the board class, this is the largest by far. It checks the validity of all moves by the piece.
It adds the block to the stack and checks if its time to end the game.



Thank you!
