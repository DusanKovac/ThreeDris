Hello!

To run this project, please use make and then run ./FruitTetris3D!

In this zip there are 3 cpp and 3 header files that I have customly created, and a couple others required for shaders and angel.h/robotarm.

fruit.cpp :

Fruit is my main file where I run all the glut/gl functions and run the main game logic 


tetrisblock.cpp/.h :

This is where I made the falling tetris block, instead of making an
object each time. It is initialised at the start and when adding the piece to 
the board the game will run the initialiser right after. This class handles all 
local translations of the piece and the drawing of it.

board.cpp/.h :

Here is the board class, this is the largest by far. It checks the validity of all moves by the piece.
It adds the block to the stack and checks if its time to end the game.
